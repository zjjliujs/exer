    The example draws a quadratic Bezier curve from 50,50 to the point 100,100
  with a control point at 50,200. The control point is the first of the two
  parameters set on the Q command.
    The control point pulls the curve like a magnet. The closer a point on the
  curve is to the control point, the more the control point pulls in it, meaning
  the closer to the control point it will be.
    In fact, if you draw a line from the start point to the control point, and
  another line from the control point to the end point, then the line from the
  middle of the first line to the middle of the second line will be a tangent of
  the curve.
